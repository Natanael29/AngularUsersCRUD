# UsersCrud

This activity consists on creating a simple CRUD that allows to create, read, updtate and delete, in my case, users using Angular Material. As we can see, the first view of the app includes a table that lists all of the existing users. In this example, we store the users using an array. Each row contains each user info and some actions that can be done to those users. As a CRUD means updating and deleting, in each row we can see a delete icon and an update icon that fire the appropriate function to delete or update. At the right of the page, there is a form that allows to create a user or, if the update icon is clicked, to update an especific user. 
This task has given me the knowledge to create a very simple CRUD using Angular Material, learning how to add the library, import the modules that the app requires, the way some resources are created such as buttons, tables, forms, etc. apart from getting some experience using Components, Models, Services and how they interact.
To conclude, from my point of view, it is a simple activity to get in touch with this new framework but it is really useful considering that most of real applications need CRUDs so that their admins can manage the database.
